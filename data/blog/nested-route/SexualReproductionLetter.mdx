I am writing to you today to express my support for sexual education in our schools. As a [parent/student/teacher], I believe that it is essential for young people to receive accurate, relevant, and comprehensive information involving sexual education.  

Sexual education is an important part of a young person's development, as it can help them make well informed decisions about their health and well-being. A good education would help reduce the rates of unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections , and other negative outcomes associated with risky sexual behavior.  

To be able to see such results in our own public schools however, it would require a change in curriculum which would entail reproductive health rights, inclusive, unbiased, untainted pure facts about how intimacy works for our younger population.
Proposed changes to the curriculum could start off with:

- Comprehensive coverage: Sexual education curriculum should provide comprehensive coverage of topics related to sexuality, including contraception, sexually transmitted infections, consent, healthy relationships, and sexual orientation and gender identity.
- Age-appropriate content: The curriculum should be tailored to the age of the students, with appropriate language and concepts. It's important to recognize that students may have varying levels of maturity and exposure to sexual content, and educators should be sensitive to these differences.
- Inclusion of diverse perspectives: The curriculum should be inclusive of diverse perspectives, including those of LGBTQ+ individuals, people of color, and those with disabilities. This can help to reduce stigma and discrimination and create a more inclusive and accepting school environment.
- Emphasis on consent: Consent is a critical component of healthy sexual relationships, and sexual education curriculum should emphasize the importance of obtaining and respecting consent.
- Incorporation of real-world scenarios: Incorporating real-world scenarios can help students to understand how to apply the concepts they are learning in their own lives. This can include case studies, role-playing exercises, and group discussions.
- Updated information: Sexual education curriculum should be regularly updated to reflect current research, best practices, and changes in laws and policies.

Although the proposed updates suggested for the curriculum could be controversial to some people, the change is needed in this ever changing world.  
Overall, the sexual education curriculum should aim to provide students with accurate and relevant information in a supportive and inclusive environment, helping them to make informed decisions about their sexual health and relationships.
