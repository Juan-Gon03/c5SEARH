>I flip ahead in the textbook. There's an interesting chapter about acid rain. Nothing about sex. We aren't scheduled to learn about that until eleventh grade.

**What is Sex Ed?**  
Sexual education relating to human sexuality, anatomy, and activity. 

**What is Reproductive Health?**  
Reproductive health is the mental, physical and emotional well being when it comes to intimacy, not only a focuses on disease.

**Eliminating Stigmas**  
Women around the world are silenced for what goes on inside their own bodies. A period or a menstrual cycle is a natural and healthy way for the body to get rid of toxins and levels sex hormones. 
A women is meant to be ashamed and judged when they simply need to go change their choice of treatment. Women at a young age are taught to hide their tampon or pad from the rest of their classmates because it’s “embarrassing”. 
In schools when we start to learn about reproductive health  girls get the talk about periods and  boys are getting talks about their erections. There is no video or curriculum about sex at a young age. Yes, parents and teachers want to keep children “innocent” but what good does that come when all students want to experiment. That experimenting can turn into teen pregnancies.  
Abstinence is an ineffective and naive way to teach children about sex. 

***Significance***  
**Teenage pregnancy**   
Education helps lower early pregnancy.
One of the biggest contributing factors of dropout rates for girls.
Contraceptives are directed towards women (despite side effects).  
**Maternal mortality rates**  
Proper care isn’t available for specific demographics,research is limited.
Knowledge of Sex Ed and Reproductive health can Decrease the amount of people who get STD/STI.
